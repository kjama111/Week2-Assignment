# Reflection

ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I feel slightly more confident with arrays and events. Im confident in making funtional buttons.
I used youtube and online assistance to help me with the conditions of my changing images. I correctly used alt text attributes.
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I was unable to make a thumbnail with changing images as Manny did on his website.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I struggle with the amount of information we are expected to learn and apply in a short space of time. JavaScript is currently the most difficult for me as I struggle to recall and implement what I learned in theory into practice via a funtional and interactive website.I just feel somewhat confident in buttons and its eventhandling/listening.
I understand this is a bootcamp and an intensive one at that, but in general I struggle to grasp many technical things in short spaces of time.

I hope to improve in the following weeks.
